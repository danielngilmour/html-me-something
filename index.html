                        As a programmer in LaunchCode 101 NWA, I am learning to use code to build and share experiences online. I wanted to use some of those tools to share the story of the final trip I took before covid-19 shut down the world.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Origin: Bentonville, Arkansas</li>
                            <li>Destination: Kerala, India</li>
                            <li>Reason: Why not? Also... our friend needed a can of pumpkin from the US for his Thanksgiving pie.</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        I typically try to travel whenever I just can't take the sheer comfort of life in the middle of the USA. When my brother proposed a visit to Kerala, India to visit a friend for Thanksgiving, I was excited to go, but did not realize just how rare an opportunity the trip would be after international travel came to an abrupt halt in 2020 due to covid-19.

                    <h3>United States</h3>
                    <p>
                        My trip began in Arkansas, where I enjoyed plenty of personal space at the XNA regional airport. It seems to be one of the most spacious terminals in the country compared to how few travelers actually fly in and out of this area. From there I flew to San Diego briefly to meet my brother and spent one afternoon visiting a museum with a friend.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I took a walk around my brother's neighborhood and happened to meet someone with a backyard view of the city. Somehow I talked my way into getting a tour and enjoyed one of the best city views in town.
                    </p>

                    <p>Finally my brother and I settled in for our long flight.</p>

                    <h3>China</h3>
                    <p>We almost got separated in the Shanghai airport, and I was starting to wonder if we would be touring China instead.</p>

                    <h3>Malaysia</h3>
                    <p>We had a brief layover in Kuala Lumpur and arrived late in India where our first few hours were a blur.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/IMG_20191123_113514.jpg" alt="Skyline">

                    </figure>
                    <h3>India</h3>
                    <p>After that, we took a train ride to our friend's home further South. I noticed the local transportation landscape was a bit different. </p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/IMG_20191124_161453.jpg" alt="Motorcycles">

                    </figure>
                    <p>When we reached the home of our friend, I was surprised at how tropical everything appeared. The houses were close together, and an interesting system of alleyways connected the interior of city blocks with the formal roads at the perimeter.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/IMG_20191125_164900.jpg" alt="Rooftop view">

                    </figure>
                    <p>One of the highlights of the trip was a visit to Varkala, a beach town that seemed to host as many European tourists seeking yoga retreats as it did local Indians. I struck up a conversation with a local jeweler and bought some fabric from a merchant in town from the Kashmir area. </p>

                    <p>Making Thanksgiving dinner took most of the day, and the result was pretty close in taste to the US traditions, give or take some Asian spices. As we celebrated the holiday in 2019, we had no idea how different the world would feel one year later.</p>
                    <figure>

                    <h3>Malaysia</h3>
                    <p>On our way back home, we spent half a day in Malaysia. We went to the top of the KL tower, but agreed not to take any pictures. The memory of sunset, city lights, and a thunderstorm on the horizon is vivid in my mind, but the only visuals I brought back were from the ground looking up.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/IMG_20191130_172537.jpg" alt="KL Tower">
                        <figcaption>The cost of admission felt a bit steep, but the view was definitely worth the price.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>Down below, we explored the woods from a wooden skywalk through the trees.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/IMG_20191130_174221.jpg" alt="Elevated forest walkway">
                        <figcaption>The combination of city and jungle was striking</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <p>The sidewalk ended on our way back to the train station, and the train to the airport was delayed. Without a local number none of the taxi apps would work on our phones, and we almost missed our return flight. Thankfully the train was fixed at the last moment, and we did not have to pool our money to hire the (price-gouging?) taxi driver who had started to advertise his services.</p>

                        <figcaption>I am not quite sure why we chose not to take the subway.</figcaption>
                    </figure>
                    <h3>United States</h3>
                    <p>When we got back to the USA, it was good to see familiar sights, even if they were just the taillights on a Toyota.</p>
                    <figure>
                        <img src="images/IMG_20191204_155301.jpg" alt="Traffic">

                    </figure>
                    <p>By the time I made it back to Arkansas, it finally felt like home. And with all the lockdowns, social distancing, masks, and health risks of 2020, a bit of Midwest stability was about the best thing I could have asked for.</p>
