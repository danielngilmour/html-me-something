            <p>I am learning to use html, css, and javascript as a new programmer to create apps, tell stories, and share them both with the world. Today it's a story. I live in Arkansas and love to travel whenever I get tired of a comfortable life in the middle of the USA. An opportunity came in 2019, when my brother and I had an amazing opportunity to travel together to South Asia, celebrate Thanksgiving with friends in India, and run through Kuala Lumpur.</p>
