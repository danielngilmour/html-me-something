        <div id="Introduction">
            <p>As a programmer in LaunchCode 101 NWA, I am learning to use html, css, and javascript to share experiences via the web. Today I am sharing the story of the last big trip I got to take before covid-19 shut down the world.
                <ul>
                    <li>Origin: Bentonville, Arkansas</li>
                    <li>Destination: Kerala, India</li>
                    <li>Reason: Why not? Also... our friend needed us to bring a can of pumpkin for the pie.</li>
                </ul>

                
            I love to travel whenever I just can't take the sheer comfort of life in the middle of the USA. When my brother proposed a visit to Kerala, India to visit a friend for Thanksgiving, I was excited to go, but did not realize just how rare an opportunity the trip would be after international travel came to an abrupt halt in 2020 due to covid-19.</p>
